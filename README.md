# The (H)ill Reloaded
The (H)ill Reloaded is an Android-developed mobile game focused on waste recycling and environmental pollution. The name, in fact, has a double meaning: the word "Hill" refers to the area where waste appears and accumulates in the game, called a hill in fact, while the word "ill" refers to the consequences of waste accumulation, which leads to pollution of the environment and makes it "sick."

The objective of the game is therefore to try to recycle as much waste as possible, each in their respective recycling units, while avoiding letting too much waste accumulate on the hill; when the waste reaches the limit of the hill the game ends.

It is possible to play in single mode or multiplayer mode; in both single mode and multiplayer mode we have two additional game modes: the "classic mode," which involves the classic rules of the game, and the "power-up mode," which involves precisely the use of power-ups that benefit the player. In the multiplayer mode, it is possible to play in "1 vs 1" mode using two different devices: the objective of this mode is to try to make the highest score of the opponent, as everyone will play their own game and at the end of both games the scores of both players will be evaluated rewarding the player with the highest score.
